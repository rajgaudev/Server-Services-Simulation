# Server-Services-Simulation

This project simulates the integration of essential server services within an enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Dedicated servers were configured for DNS, HTTP, DHCP, DHCPv6, Syslog, FTP, TFTP, Email, NTP, and AAA to ensure efficient communication, centralized management, and secure access across the 192.168.1.0/24 network topology.

üìå Server Services:

DNS & HTTP - Domain resolution and web hosting

DHCP & DHCPv6 - Automatic IPv4/IPv6 addressing

Syslog - Centralized device logging and monitoring

FTP & TFTP - File transfers and configuration backups

Email - Internal communication services

NTP - Time synchronization across devices

AAA - Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting for secure access

üìå Key Highlights:

‚úî Enterprise network topology with dedicated servers
‚úî Centralized log monitoring and secure access control
‚úî Automatic IP assignment (IPv4 & IPv6)
‚úî Real-time email exchange tested successfully
‚úî Time synchronization and configuration backup ensured
‚úî Demonstrates integration of multiple services in a single simulation

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Open with Cisco Packet Tracer version 7.3.1
