# Server-Services-Simulation
This project simulates the integration of essential server services within an enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Dedicated servers were configured for DNS, HTTP, DHCP, DHCPv6, Syslog, FTP, TFTP, Email, NTP, and AAA to ensure efficient communication, centralized management, and secure access across the 192.168.1.0/24 network topology.
